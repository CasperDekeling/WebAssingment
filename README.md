# WDT Game: MasterMind
Welcome to MasterMind!
This is our implementation of the fun code-breaking game.
It's far from perfect, but we did our best!
Make sure to turn on your sound, but not too loud, because the effects can be rather loud. :)

This game does not work for screens with a resolution of less than 1366x768.

If you're playing the game with a big enough screen, but the game still gives you the "resolution not high enough" alert, 
zooming out a tiny bit tends to fix it.

This project was made primarily on Chrome, but also works in Firefox. We didn't test other browsers.

The game was, for the most part, made on a 27inch screen, so it works best on a large screen, but it's still playable on smaller screens.

To run the game, just cd into the myapp folder, run 'npm install', and then 'npm start'!
Then go into your browser, and go to the url 'localhost:3000'. If you wan't to change the port, you have to edit the package.json file. :)
