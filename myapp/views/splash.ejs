        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 8 different coloured pins. One player makes a code out of 4 pins, the order also matters!. Colours can be used multiple times.</li>
            <li>The other player has 10 guesses to crack the code. The player chooses 4 pins and places them on the board in the order they want.</li>
            <li>After submitting a guess, the player that made the code has to rate the guess, they do this by rating each individual pin. A pin can be rated in 3 ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Green: The pin is of the right colour, and in the right place.</li>
                    <li>Yellow: The pin is of the right colour, but not in the right place.</li>
                    <li>Red: This colour pin is not in the code.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The guesser then gets back these 4 ratings, however, the guesser does not know which rating belongs to which pin. So all the guesser knows, is that they had <em>x</em> pins that were the right colour and in the right spot, <em>y</em> pins that were the right colour, but in the wrong spot, and <em>z</em> pins that were not in the combination at all.</li>
            <li>If the guesser can crack the code within 10 guesses, they win, otherwise, the code-maker wins!</li>
            <li>Click (and hold) on the logo to the right for a surprise!</li>
